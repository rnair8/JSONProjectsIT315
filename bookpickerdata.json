        "BookDescription":"A devious tale of psychological suspense so irresistible that it prompts Entertainment Weekly to ask, Is The Kind Worth Killing the next Gone Girl? From one of the hottest new thriller writers, Peter Swanson, a name you may not know yet (but soon will), this is his breakout novel in the bestselling tradition of Paula Hawkins The Girl on the Train—and is soon to be a major movie directed by Agnieszka Holland. In a tantalizing set-up reminiscent of Patricia Highsmith’s classic Strangers on a Train. On a night flight from London to Boston, Ted Severson meets the stunning and mysterious Lily Kintner. Sharing one too many martinis, the strangers begin to play a game of truth, revealing very intimate details about themselves. Ted talks about his marriage that is going stale and his wife Miranda, who he is sure is cheating on him.But their game turns a little darker when Ted jokes that he could kill Miranda for what she has done. Lily, without missing a beat, says calmly, I would like to help",
